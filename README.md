I am going to talk about Growth Mindset and how important it can be for people who have this mindset.

Now basically growth mindset means that you should be dedicated to do what you're actually doing, so the harder you work the more results you will see. It has a significant impact on your life.

## An Example

To illustarte my point, I am going to give you an example of how I remind myself to have a **growth mindset**

1. When I learn something new no matter how difficult it may sound for other people, I laways tell myself I will do it
2. If someone _critique_ my work, I will consider this as a valubale feedback on the mistakes I've done.
3. I never ever say something like "I am gonna give up" or "there is no way I am gonna go on", I always say "**I Can Do It**"
